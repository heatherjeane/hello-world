# hello-world
My first repository. Let's do this thing. 

In the beginning, I created a "hello world" repository, but the story starts long before the beginning.
I'm an architectural photographer, turned book editor, turned web developer...almost.
This is the beginning of me becoming a web developer. So, cheers to new beginnings!
